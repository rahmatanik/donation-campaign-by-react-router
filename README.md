## Here are three project features for my donation project explained below:

- Browse Donation Topics: Users can explore a variety of charitable causes, such as education, health, and foods and clothings. They have access to detailed information about each cause, including descriptions and images that help them understand the impact of their potential donations.
- Effortless Donation: Once users find a cause that resonates with them, they can seamlessly make a donation. The donation process is user-friendly, with a straightforward interface that guides them through the contribution process step by step, when user click the conation card then they'll redirect to the donation details page and will find the donate button with price there.

- Donation History: Users will have a dedicated "Donation" page where they can access the list of all their recent donations. They can see all items by clicking the "See all" button there.
